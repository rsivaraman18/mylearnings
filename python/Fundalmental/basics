Common Operators in Python

1.Arithmetic Operators    -->   +,-,*,/, %,//

2.Relational Operators    -->   ==,!=,>,<,>=,<=

3.Assignment Operators    -->   =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=

4.Logical Operators       -->   and,or,not


These are Empty in Python -->  None ,False , 0 ,''/"" ,(Empty string - two single quotes/double quotes)


Implict Type Conversion   
case 1: Converts a int to float.
print(1 + 1.0 +1.0 )  --> 3.0 float

Explict Conversion:
case1 : We need to convert it before
print(1 + int(1.0) )    --> 2  int


To avoid dangerous result:
Convert data to requred format.
Integer   --> int(any data)
String    --> str(any data)
Boolean   --> bool(any data)


Escapes Sequences always start with backslash
1. \n  --> new line
2. \t  --> tab space
3. \"  --> quotes in sentence
4. 

Example lines:
print("Let's see some examples.\n\nDid you notice the empty lines?")
print("Do you notice\t the tab space?\nDid you see that I have moved to next line?")
print("Do you want a \" in your text?")
print("Are you going to store more info about escape sequence in Z:\\\\user\\escape_sequence.txt??")
#Every print starts with a new line, end can change that behavior by specifying your own character
print("Did you see I start here", end=" ")
print("and I end in the same line although from a different print?")
print("As observed escape sequences help you to format your output.").
