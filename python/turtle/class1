# Turtle is a builtin function in Python.
# So we can use it using the command Import turtle.
# it is graphical represantational of a structure.

Problem Cases:
1.To Draw a circle with 50 radius.
2.To Draw a circle with user input data

#Case 1: To Draw a circle with 50 radius.
def circle1( ):
  import turtle       
  import time
  
  
  #circle_rad = int(input("enter your radius : " ))  #Enter radius
  circle_rad = 50

  alex = turtle.Turtle()  # create a turtle named alex
  alex.shape("turtle")    # alex looks like a turtle
  alex.color('red')       # alex has a color
  alex.circle(circle_rad)
  time.sleep(5)           # hold for certain time


#Case 2:To Draw a circle with user input data
def circle2( ):
  import turtle       
  import time  
  
  circle_rad   = int(input("enter your radius : " ))  
  circle_color = input("color of circle : " )
  
  alex = turtle.Turtle()        # create a turtle named alex
  alex.shape("turtle")          # alex looks like a turtle
  alex.color(circle_color)      # alex has a color
  alex.circle(circle_rad)
  time.sleep(5) 

#Case 3: To draw a Rectangle with width = 150 & height = 80.
